Cone + MuSHR - v1 Normal
==============================

This dataset was exported via roboflow.ai on December 14, 2021 at 11:19 PM GMT

It includes 1413 images.
Cone-mushrcar are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 416x416 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random rotation of between -30 and +30 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -40 and +40 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2 pixels
